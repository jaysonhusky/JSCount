JS Count
=========

Simple Javascript & PHP Link counter. A fun interactions script for any website.

## Instructions

- Copy "count.js", "initCount.php" and "click_data.txt" to your website.
- Edit the paths to the files as required. Relative or Absolute is fine.
- Set your unique reference URLS (as shown in the Index.html demo page), so that the script may distinguish them apart.
- Add the unique references to the click_data.txt file, to ensure it has an initial value. This is store in the format
variable,value. So an example is "uniqueref1,0" without the quotes.
- Finally copy and paste the click div into your page, where you wish the counter to be and launch the script.
